# Depracated for now

# Kattungar

Kattungar is a turn based, party-based RPG. The server side is written with Node.js and WS, and the front end is written with Pixi and TypeScript. In the near future, I will be migrating the HTTP requests over to WS as well. The API functionality wasn't really something that ended up being terribly useful.

Currently this is simply a multiplayer pre-alpha, but eventually it will expand further.
